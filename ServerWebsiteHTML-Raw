<h3>About this Site</h3>
<p>This website is a <strong>local web server</strong> that stores things I want to have access to if the Internet goes down. Or if I am traveling to a place with spotty WiFi and want to make sure I have access to certain books/documents. Or heck, if I'm moving and my ISP is taking its sweet time to get me hooked up to the Internet. Or, you know, if the weather decides that it is dismantling our cable infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are tons of reasons why this local network would be helpful! Those are a few of mine.</p>
<p>I also want to help folks get used to building web servers and hosting information so that we could ultimately build a public Internet!</p>
<p>Heck yes, power to the people :)</p>
